## Brute Force Password Script

### Introduction

This batch file is designed to help you retrieve a forgotten password from a system when you have the username and IP address of the target system. Please note that attempting to access a system without permission is illegal and unethical. This script should only be used for educational or authorized testing purposes.

### How it Works

#### 1. Requirements
   - Windows Operating System
   - Access to Command Prompt
   - Pre-built password file for the target system

#### 2. Getting Started
   - Run the batch file (`bruteforce.bat`) from the Command Prompt.
   - Follow the prompts to enter the username, IP address, and provide the path to the pre-built password file for the target system.

#### 3. Brute Force Process
   - The script will attempt to guess the password for the provided username on the target system.
   - It does this by trying passwords from the provided password file until it finds the correct password.
   - This method is called brute force because it systematically tries every password in the file until it succeeds.

#### 4. Use Responsibly
   - Brute forcing passwords is time-consuming and can be detected by security systems.
   - Make sure you have permission to access the target system before using this script.
   - Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and can have serious consequences.
